KNN for Regression – Implementation Guidelines

1
1. Import data set
2. Separate X (Gender, Height) and Y (y=Weight).
3. Train = 70%, Test = 30%
4. Apply Linear Regression
5. Evaluate the Model (Testing and training Accuracy, MSE for testing)
6. Apply KNN Regressor: Scikit-Learn Link
7. Evaluate the Model (Testing and training Accuracy, MSE for testing)
8. Compare KNN & Linear Regression with the KNN Model and Linear regression as well.

KNN for Classification – Implementation Guidelines

1. Import data set
2. Separate X and Y. (y=Gender)
3. Train = 70%, Test = 30%
4. Apply KNN Classifier
5. Evaluate the Model by only Accuracy.
6. Apply KNN Classifier: Scikit-Learn Link
